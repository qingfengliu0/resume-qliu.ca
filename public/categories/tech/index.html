                <p>Static site generators (SSGs) are tools that compile templates and content into static HTML files. Unlike traditional dynamic websites that generate pages on the server with each request, static sites are pre-built and served directly to users, which can lead to faster load times and better security.
What is a Static Site Generator? A static site generator takes content (usually written in Markdown) and templates (often written in HTML) and combines them to generate static HTML files.</p>
