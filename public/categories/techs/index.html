                <p>Web performance optimization (WPO) is a critical aspect of web development that focuses on improving the speed, responsiveness, and overall user experience of a website. A fast-loading website not only provides a better experience for users but also ranks higher in search engine results.
Why Web Performance Matters When users visit a website, they expect it to load quickly. Studies have shown that even a one-second delay in page load time can lead to a significant drop in user satisfaction and conversions.</p>
